# GaN-NanoWire-Image-Tracking-
Research Project to write software to detect and follow an Gallium Nitride nanowire floating in a magnet trap. 
Worked with Charles Rogers and Max Chen [this paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329574933_Axisymmetric_scalable_magneto-gravitational_trap_for_diamagnetic_particle_levitation/)
- Runs out of the box
- change DoPlot to 1 if you want to see how the wire is tracked at each frame. This will increase run time.
